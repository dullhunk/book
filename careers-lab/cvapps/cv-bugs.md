# Debugging your CV / Résumé

This guide [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv) is written to help you debug your [Curriculum Vitae 🇪🇺 🇬🇧(CV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae), based on common bugs 🐛 we've seen in students CVs (aka [Résumés 🇺🇸](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9))  submitted to the [School of Computer Science CV Bank](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/industryclub/cvbank) at the University of Manchester.

Wherever criticism of your CV comes from, don't take it personally -  it is probably one of the first you have written. Think of your current CV as version 0.1, [alpha or perhaps beta release](Software release life cycle). There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study - find out more at [man.ac.uk/U1q7VI](http://man.ac.uk/U1q7VI) and [man.ac.uk/6Ef90a](http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a) The aim of this guide is not to demoralise you, but to help you improve your CV. Employers often tell us that Computer Science graduates lack written communication skills, with CV being the prime example.

> DISCLAIMER: If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three different and probably contradictory opinions. CV's are a very subjective thing. The advice below is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with members of our [industry club](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/industry/club/). What makes a good CV will depend on the personal preferences and prejudices of the reader. There are some general rules, which are described below.

While referring to this guide, remember that:
1. the **main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job**. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview but not give your whole life story
2. the chances are, your CV will be [assessed in seconds](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23/resume-tips-for-post-50s_n_1372705.html), rather than minutes so brevity really is key
3. Bullet points are good way to be brief, leading with key verbs [git.io/verbsfirst](http://git.io/verbsfirst), rather than lengthy sections of prose

## Next steps

Once you've read the above, here's what you could do next:

* **RELEASE OFTEN** Having [released your CV early, keep releasing it often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often). According to [Linus's (Torvald's) Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law) ''*given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow*''. So the more people who see your CV, the more bugs you can squash. Do a CV swap and peer-review with a fellow student (if you haven't already). Show it to your friends, colleagues, family, personal tutor, pet dog etc. The more people who see it, the better it will get. You can apply many of the the principles of [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) to your CV.
* **IMPROVING** See five steps to take next: 1) Explore, 2) Connect, 3) Communicate, 4) Reflect and 5) Apply [careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture/) and if you are in:
  * First year of your degree, see [careers.manchester.ac.uk/first](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/first/)
  * Middle years of your degree, see  [careers.manchester.ac.uk/middegree](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/middegree/)
  * Final years of your degree, see [careers.manchester.ac.uk/final](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/final/)
* **RE-CHECK** Have another look at the CV and LinkedIn guide from the careers service [man.ac.uk/6Ef90a](http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a) there is good advice mentioned there that is not in this guide
* **UPLOAD** Upload an updated version to the CV bank once you've changed it [studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/industryclub/cvbank](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/industryclub/cvbank)
* **REJECTION** It is hard work finding a job, most people will make several unsuccessful job applications and have multiple interviews before receiving a job offer from an employer they are interested in. Coping with rejection is routine part of applying for jobs. Keep trying and aim to get better each time, learning from your mistakes rather than repeating them.
* **SUGGESTIONS?** If you have any comments or suggestions on how to improve this guide, [raise an issue](https://github.com/dullhunk/book/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/dullhunk/book/compare). The source is written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and I welcome constructive feedback on how it could be improved.

Good luck with your applications and interviews. If you need any help speak to [Mabel Yau](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mabel-yau/26/152/a5), your personal tutor or myself. The [careers service](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/services/guidance/) also provide good non-technical generic advice. I'm happy to give more feedback on improved versions of your CV in the future, while you are at University.
