The Northern software house
========================================================

## Employers in Manchester that recruit Computer Scientists
This is a partial list of employers in Manchester ([Manc-hattan?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000182g)) and the [Northern Powerhouse](https://northernpowerhouse.gov.uk/) that recruit Computer Science students. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and [Northern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England).

## Hit the North, Not Just London

You don't **have** to move to London to find top employers, there are plenty located here in the North West if you'd like to stick around after you graduate. It is often argued that [Manchester offers a better quality of life than London](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/07/manchester-offers-best-quality-of-life-for-young-graduates-says-report) we couldn't possibly comment other than to say its [horses for courses](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/horses_for_courses). The North West Tech Community calendar [@technwuk](https://twitter.com/technwuk), provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West [technw.uk](http://technw.uk) if you want to find out more.
