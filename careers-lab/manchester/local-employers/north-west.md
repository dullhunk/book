## Hit the North: Not Just London

You don't **have** to move to London to find top employers, there are plenty located here in the North West if you'd like to stick around after you graduate. It is often argued that [Manchester offers a better quality of life than London](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/07/manchester-offers-best-quality-of-life-for-young-graduates-says-report) we couldn't possibly comment other than to say its [horses for courses](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/horses_for_courses). The North West Tech Community calendar [@technwuk](https://twitter.com/technwuk), provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West [technw.uk](http://technw.uk) if you want to find out more.
